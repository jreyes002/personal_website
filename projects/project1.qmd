subtitle: What happened to Facebook's/Meta's Metaverse? Who cared about it then and now?

I was struggling to come up with ideas for my DH 120: Social Media Data Analytics research project and often found myself jumping between multiple ideas. Then, I was suggested by my TA to do something on (formerly) Facebook's Metaverse, since I was previously thinking about digital entertainment for my idea. I thought, "do people still care about the Metaverse?", and that's how this project came to be. I was not only interested in what happened to the Metaverse, but also how its fallout potentially impacted future innovation in this sphere.

This research project dives into this topic and specifically asks: How has public sentiment towards the Metaverse evolved since it was unveiled during the COVID-19 pandemic? What does this reveal about societal attitudes towards digital innovation and virtual worlds?

The short answer: the main population that was interested in the Metaverse in the beginning and even now was crypto enthusiasts; the Metaverse failed to capture and retain the attention of a wider audience. Despite the Metaverse's appearance in the public spotlight being brief, it likely left a bad taste in many potential consumers, stifling future interest.

Here is the [white paper](metaverse.pdf), as well as an accompanying info graphic for a quick summary of my findings.
