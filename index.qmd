## Bio

Hello! My name is Jeremy Reyes. I'm currently a 4th year student at UCLA who transferred from Long Beach City College. While my major is in Stats and Data Science, I also am minoring in Digital Humanities. Combined together, I often consider myself a strong candidate for the creative side of statistical analysis and visualization.

I created this site to show off some of the work I'm most proud of.
