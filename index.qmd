## Bio

Hello! My name is Jeremy Reyes. I'm currently a 4th year student at UCLA who transferred from Long Beach City College. While my major is in Stats and Data Science, I'm also minoring in Digital Humanities. Combined together, I often consider myself a strong candidate for the creative side of statistical analysis and visualization.

## About

I created this site to show off some of the work I'm most proud of from my time at UCLA. This includes projects from my Digital Humanities 120 - Social Media Data Analytics and STATS 140XP - Practice of Statistical Consulting classes, but other relevant classes include DH 101 and the STATS 101 series.
